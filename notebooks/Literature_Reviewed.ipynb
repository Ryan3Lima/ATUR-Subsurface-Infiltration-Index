    "> 1. This paper recommends using mountain/hillslope managed aquifer recharge Hillslope-MAR and water chaptured by roadside channel networks as a potential new source and setting for MAR applications.\n",
    "> 2. Suggests that road system-based managed aquifer recharge (Road-MAR) could have high potential for enhancing recharge through things like infiltrations channels.\n",
    "> 3. Roads on mountain sides and hillslopes passing through areas with high concentrations of lineaments could be suitable areas\n",
